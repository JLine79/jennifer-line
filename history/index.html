        <h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
          <p>I have a first class degree in International Business with Italian from Sheffield Hallam University, and more life-lessons and on-the-job learning experiences than I can recount. Over the years I have trained in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Monitoring, Evaluation &amp; Learning</li>
              <li>Leadership</li>
              <li>Data Visualisation</li>
              <li>Customer Friendly Writing</li>
              <li>Valuation of land for affordable housing</li>
              <li>Front End Development &amp; Coding &lpar;new skills on the way!&rpar;</li>

          <h3>Data</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Lots of people seem to hate data. Not me. I love a good spreadsheet. Tableau, SPSS and Access are my friends. Data holds the mysteries of the world around us, if we can just see the patterns.</p>
        <p>In past roles I've used data constantly to see trends, develop understanding and hone arguments. Mining, understanding, presenting, interpreting and using data are some of my favourite things to do. I can dive into that mess of spreadsheets you've been squirrelling away, work out what your Google Analytics are telling you, or find some good old secondary datasets to provide you with some perspective.</p>

          <h3>Project Management</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Project Management is the theme that has run most consistently through my career. I've run localisation projects for international clients, produced research, delivered funded projects and annual awards.</p>
        <p>I don't have a Prince II qualification &lpar;before you ask&rpar; but I do have exceptional organisational skills. Inbox zero anyone?</p>

          <h3>Facilitation</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I have worked with people enough to know you can't get anywhere without them. I took a course in facilitation, and practiced putting theory into practice. </p>
        <p>I can help bring people together, bring views out into the open and navigate ways through differences to the common ground underneath. I will work with you to design and run sessions to draw out experiences, understand perspectives and reach decisions.</p>

          <h3>People</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I'm somewhere between an introvert and an extrovert when it comes to people. In practice, this means that I can nurture conversations effectively, but then shut up long enough to hear and reflect on what's being said. </p>
        <p>My professional history with people includes advocacy for affordable housing and community led housing, line management, event facilitation, network management and board membership.</p>

          <h3>Housing Expertise</h3>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>I worked in housing-related roles for over 12 years. I have contributed to many different things, carrying out research, running events and awards, presenting, and working with panels and expert groups. I've worked in a research consultancy, a local authority and an international charity. I'm also currently vice-chair of Leicestershire Rural Housing Association.</p>
