    <p> I spent over 20 years doing project management, research and numerous other things before figuring out that tech is for me. There's a lot that comes in useful for getting things done. This page is a summary of my experiences and skills, should you need them...</p>

        <h3>Education &amp; Training</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
      <p>I have a first class degree in International Business with Italian from Sheffield Hallam University.<br>
          I spent 6 months in Italy studying International Economics &lpar;or &apos;Economia Internazionale&apos;, if you like&rpar;, and another 12 months working as a translator in Milan.</p>
      <p> Over the years I have taken numerous training courses on things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Valuation of land for affordable housing</li>
          <li>Monitoring, Evaluation &amp; Learning</li>
          <li>Leadership</li>
          <li>Data Visualisation</li>
          <li>Customer Friendly Writing</li>
          <li>Front End Development &amp; Coding &lpar;new skills on the way!&rpar;</li>
        </ul>
      <p> And had more life-lessons and on-the-job learning experiences than I can recount.</p>

      <h3>Data</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
    <p>Lots of people seem to hate data. Not me. I love a good spreadsheet. Tableau, SPSS and Access are my friends. Data holds the mysteries of the world around us, if we can just see the patterns.</p>
    <p>In past roles I've used data constantly to see trends, develop understanding and hone arguments. Mining, understanding, presenting, interpreting and using data are some of my favourite things to do.</p>
    <p>How is this relevant to you? Well, everyone benefits from understanding themselves and others better. I can dive into that mess of spreadsheets you've been squirrelling away, work out what your Google Analytics are telling you, or find some good old secondary datasets that help explain your context better.<br>
      Trust me, data is power.</p>

      <h3>Project Management</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
    <p>Project Management is the theme that has run most consistently through my career. I've run localisation projects for international clients, produced research, delivered funded projects and annual awards.</p>
    <p>I don't have a Prince II qualification &lpar;before you ask&rpar; but I do have exceptional organisational skills. Inbox zero anyone?</p>

        <h3>Facilitation</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
    <p>I have worked with people enough to know you can't get anywhere without them. I took a course in facilitation, read a few books and practiced putting theory into practice. </p>
    <p>I can help bring people together, bring views out into the open and navigate ways through differences to the common ground underneath. I've designed and run several sessions to draw out experiences and reach decisions between groups, both within and between organisations and individuals</p>

      <h3>People</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
    <p>I'm somewhere between an introvert and an extrovert when it comes to people. In practice, this means that I can nurture conversations effectively, but then shut up long enough to hear and reflect on what's being said. </p>
    <p>My professional history with people includes advocacy for affordable housing and community led housing, line management, event facilitation, network management and board membership.</p>

      <h3>Housing Expertise</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
    <p>I worked in housing-related roles for over 12 years. I have contributed to many different things, carrying out research, running events and awards, presenting, and working with panels and expert groups. I've been in a research consultancy, a local authority and an international charity. I'm also currently vice-chair of Leicestershire Rural Housing Association.</p>
